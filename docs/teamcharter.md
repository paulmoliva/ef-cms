Core Team Values:
* Respect and Appreciation - Respect and appreciation are basic human values that positively impact other areas like performance, workplace enjoyment, and team relationships. 
* Communication - As a team we value open and honest communication between team members in all aspects of work. 
* Knowledge Sharing - We value sharing as much knowledge as possible with team members to allow us to build a quality product.
* Experimentation - Because we don’t know what we don’t know, we can’t give a clear cut answer/solution. By experimenting it increases optionality and helps us learn/reveal what we don’t know through the process of elimination. Sometimes multiple experiments are needed and failures can inform successes.
* Quality - It's a fundamental value that ensures confidence, enables users at all levels to effectively achieve their goals (perform their duties). We strive to develop processes that increase the overall quality of our code and product.
* Psychological Safety - Team members should feel safe to explore their ideas. Psych safety in a team ensures that all paths are seen as viable, therefore helping generate options in order to find the most effective and high quality path forward. Mistakes are valued as learning opportunities and failure generates more knowledge
* Relationship Building - We encourage trust, strengthen our comfort in communicating with others, diversity of opinions, and foster empathy. 

Team Working Agreement:
* Methods of Communication - Slack is the preferred messaging platform. Our slack workspace is organized into rooms with clear topics for focused discussion. The team maintains a #welcome channel with a directory of channels with clear descriptions and posting guidelines.
* Retrospectives - We retrospect often, following up on past experiments and other topics and coming up with future experiments to improve the team and project. We courageously bring topics to the retro in a psychologically safe space.
* Meetings - Bring attention to questions or comments in the zoom chat to the presenter, as they are not always able to see them.  While zooming, we value the relationship benefits of cameras on, but also respect the right to have cameras off.  When creating meeting invites, be respectful of other people's time. This includes only inviting those who will find value in the meeting, and marking attendees as optional where appropriate. Care should also be taken to schedule during attendees' core working hours and not overlap with previously scheduled meetings.
* Voting - As a team we will use multiple methods of voting for decision making within the team. The team will use Roman voting for quick feedback from the group on a singular topic. The team will use dot voting for discussions that have a variety of options to choose from in order to narrow down to a smaller list of actionable items.  Planning poker will be the tool we will use for estimation voting on the urgency and importance in regards to the DevEx/OpEx backlog.
* Verbal Communication - Do your share of listening, and then verbally ask questions when you don’t understand.  Use the hand raising mechanism in Zoom to draw attention to your question.  Verbally checking for understanding is better than assuming.  Verbalize your concerns because others feel the same way.  Sometimes verbal communication doesn’t work, so try other communication mechanisms.

Technical Working Agreement
* Smoke and integration tests are accurate to real life scenarios
* We don't merge a PR unless it's associated build is passing and the PR as at least one approval
* When merge conflicts are encountered, we post in the public channel so that no team members feel left out and can help with resolution. 
* When a bug-fix or story has unexpected side-effects, reach out to the assignee of that issue so they can address the feedback. 
* UX will collaborate with engineering when a technical issue arises over a design, before and during development.
* For all code and bugs, write a failing test  that covers the desired behavior, implement the desired behavior so the test passes, and refactor as needed.
