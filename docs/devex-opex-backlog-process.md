# Backlog Population
 A Trello card is added by an engineer with the following details added to the card:
  - Background
  - Pre-condition
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Breadth or pervasiveness of problem
  - Complexity of problem

# Refinement and Prioritization Process
 - The person who added the card explains the intent of the card and answers questions from the team for clarity
- The team considers how the information presented would affect their perceived **importance** and **urgency**.
- The team uses Fibonacci numbering to prioritize (NOT SIZE) the item based on importance and urgency
The cards are reordered in priority order and should be picked up in priority order; 13s, then 8s, then 5s, etc.
