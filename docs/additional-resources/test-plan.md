# DAWSON Test Plan

### Summary
As Flexion and the US Tax Court approach the launch of the new DAWSON Case Management System in December of 2020, Flexion will be putting additional testing measures into place to ensure that critical and high-priority bugs are found and resolved more expeditiously. While current testing methods Flexion has put into place are robust and thorough, we believe that expanding our testing methods is prudent in light of the complexity of the DAWSON system, as well as the complexity of the US Tax Court’s business needs. This plan includes Flexion’s already-established testing practices as well as enhanced practices for launch.

In addition to expanding testing in Flexion’s environments, we are also including our recommendations for testing practices in the Tax Court’s environments.

### Goals
* Bring transparency to Flexion testing practices
* Identify gaps in testing practices
* Continue to deliver a consistent product each sprint
* Minimize the number of bugs present in the production environment at launch
* Identify and address bugs as fast and efficiently as possible
* Enhance visibility of bug tracking and prioritization
